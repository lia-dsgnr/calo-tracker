## Goals

### Business Goals

* Acquire 10,000 active users within 6 months of launch through organic social media growth and word-of-mouth in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

* Achieve 40% weekly active user retention rate by month 3, demonstrating product stickiness and habit formation.

* Establish brand recognition as the go-to health tool for Vietnamese youth, positioning for future monetization through premium features or partnerships with fitness brands.

* Build a comprehensive Vietnamese food database with 2,000+ local dishes within the first 3 months through user contributions and manual curation.

* Maintain user engagement with an average of 5+ logging sessions per user per week, indicating regular habit formation.

### User Goals

* Effortlessly track daily calorie intake in under 30 seconds per meal using familiar Vietnamese foods and portion sizes.

* Gain awareness of nutritional content in common Vietnamese dishes (phở, bánh mì, cơm tấm, etc.) to make healthier choices.

* Visualize progress toward personal health goals through simple, motivating dashboards showing streaks, trends, and achievements.

* Develop sustainable eating habits without restrictive dieting, focusing on awareness rather than punishment.

* Access the app seamlessly on mobile devices during meals at street vendors, restaurants, or home without complicated processes.

### Non-Goals

* Building a comprehensive fitness tracking system with exercise logging or workout plans—focus remains solely on nutrition.

* Creating a social network or community features in the initial release—users track privately without comparison pressure.

* Developing native iOS/Android apps immediately—web-first approach prioritizes reach and rapid iteration before platform-specific investments.
