# RFP to Design Estimation

When the user provides RFD, PRD, or Feature requirements, follow this workflow:

## Step 1: Classify the Task Type

Analyze the requirements and classify into ONE of these types:

| Task Type | Use When |
|-----------|----------|
| Research | Discovery, user research, competitive analysis |
| New Feature | Building new functionality from scratch |
| Enhancement | Improving or extending existing features |
| Prototype | Quick validation or stakeholder buy-in |
| Design Exploration | Blue-sky thinking, concept exploration |
| Design System | Creating/updating components and patterns |
| Quick Fix | Minor changes (typos, spacing, small bugs) |
| UX Writing | Microcopy, content design, messaging |

## Step 2: Suggest the Workflow

Based on classification, reference `task-based-workflows.md` to determine:
- Required phases (R)
- Optional phases (O)
- Phases to skip (—)

### Deliverable Sequence (for New Feature)

```
DEFINE: JTBD → User Story → Feature List → User Flow
EXPLORE: IA → Visual Solution
DELIVER: Final UI → Handoff
```

**Note:** User Story is Required (R) for New Feature, Optional (O) for other task types.

Present the recommended phases and deliverables to the user.

## Step 3: Allow Customization

Ask the user if they want to:
- Add or remove any phases
- Adjust deliverables
- Modify the workflow

## Step 4: Create Design Estimation & Planning

Generate a combined Design Estimation & Planning document:

### Effort Scale
- **S (Small)**: < 4 hours
- **M (Medium)**: 4-16 hours (0.5-2 days)
- **L (Large)**: 16-40 hours (2-5 days)
- **XL (Extra Large)**: 40+ hours (1+ week)

### Output Format

```
# Design Estimation & Planning: [Project Name]

## Task Classification
- **Type:** [Task Type]
- **Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High]

## Summary

| # | Phase | Deliverables | Effort | Status |
|---|-------|--------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | [Phase] | [Deliverables] | [S/M/L] | ☐ |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ☐ |

**Total Estimated Effort:** [X hours/days] (includes 20% buffer)

---

## Phase X: [Phase Name]

| | Details |
|---|---------|
| **Input** | [Required inputs] |
| **Design Methods** | [Methods to use] |
| **Output** | [Expected deliverables] |
| **Effort** | [S/M/L] |

### Activities
- [ ] Activity 1
- [ ] Activity 2

### Deliverables
| Deliverable | Description | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| [Name] | [Description] | ☐ |

---

## Risks & Dependencies
- [List any risks]
- [List dependencies on other teams/work]

## Notes
- [Any additional context]
```

## Step 5: Get Started

Once the document is created, guide the user to begin execution:

1. **Confirm readiness** - Ask if the user wants to start working on the first phase
2. **Start with Phase 1** - Begin the first applicable phase activities
3. **Track progress** - Update deliverable status as work progresses
4. **Move through phases** - Guide transition between phases as deliverables are completed
