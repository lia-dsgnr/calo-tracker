# Project Initialization

## Dependencies

None. This is a standalone skill that creates the foundation for other skills.

## When to Use

- "Create a new project"
- "Init project [name]"
- "Set up project structure"
- "Scaffold new project"
- "Start new project for [product]"
- Beginning any new product or feature workspace

## Process

1. **Get project name** - Ask user:
   - "What is the project name? (use kebab-case, e.g., `my-app`, `bulk-cancellation`)"
   - Validate: lowercase, hyphens only, no spaces

2. **Confirm location** - Ask user:
   - "Create project in current directory, or specify a different path?"
   - Default: current working directory

3. **Ask about features** - Ask user:
   - "Will this project have multiple features? If yes, list the feature names (comma-separated, kebab-case)."
   - Example: `bulk-cancellation, patient-portal, waitlist`
   - If no features specified, skip feature folder creation (can add later)

4. **Check for existing folders** - Before creating:
   - If target directory has existing folders, warn user
   - Ask: "Directory contains existing files. Continue and merge? (existing files won't be overwritten)"

5. **Create folder structure** - Execute the following:

```bash
# Documentation & Discovery
mkdir -p docs/{research,personas,journeys,IA,briefs,competitive-analysis,requirements,guides,reusable,migration,style,archive}

# Design Artifacts
mkdir -p design/ui/{style-guide,icons,illustrations,components,design-system}
mkdir -p design/ux/{wireframes,patterns,flows}
mkdir -p design/{prototypes,a11y,animations}

# Source Code - Shared (layer-based)
mkdir -p src/{components,shared,pages,services,hooks,utils,assets,styles,lib}

# Source Code - Features (feature-based)
# For each feature specified in step 3:
mkdir -p src/[feature-name]/{components,hooks,utils,services,types}
# Example: mkdir -p src/bulk-cancellation/{components,hooks,utils,services,types}

# Development Tools
mkdir -p dev/{tests,config,scripts,types,mocks,deploy,logs}

# Team & Collaboration
mkdir -p team/{docs,meetings,decisions}

# Feedback & Analytics
mkdir -p feedback/{user-testing,analytics,issues,surveys,session-recordings,bug-reports}

# Planning & Releases
mkdir -p roadmap/milestones
mkdir -p changelog/releases
```

6. **Create .gitkeep files** - Preserve empty folders in git:
   - Add `.gitkeep` to all leaf directories

7. **Generate meta files:**

   **README.md** (root):
   ```markdown
   # [Project Name]

   ## Overview

   [Brief project description - to be filled in]

   ## Quick Start

   ```bash
   # Setup instructions
   ```

   ## Project Structure

   See `docs/guides/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for detailed folder organization.

   ## Contributing

   See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines.

   ---

   **Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
   ```

   **CONTRIBUTING.md** (root):
   ```markdown
   # Contributing to [Project Name]

   ## Getting Started

   1. Clone the repository
   2. Review the project structure in `docs/guides/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
   3. Check existing documentation in `docs/`

   ## Folder Conventions

   - **docs/** - Discovery & research artifacts
   - **design/** - UI/UX design files
   - **src/** - Application source code
   - **dev/** - Development tools & config
   - **team/** - Team collaboration docs
   - **feedback/** - User feedback & analytics
   - **roadmap/** - Product planning
   - **changelog/** - Version history

   ## Naming Conventions

   - Use kebab-case for file names: `user-persona-template.md`
   - Use ISO dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Be descriptive: `checkout-user-flow.fig` not `flow1.fig`

   ## Code of Conduct

   [To be defined]
   ```

8. **Copy PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Place in `docs/guides/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

9. **Output summary** - Show user what was created:
   ```
   Project "[name]" initialized successfully!

   Created folders:
   ├── docs/          (12 subfolders)
   ├── design/        (9 subfolders)
   ├── src/           (9 shared subfolders)
   │   ├── [feature-1]/   (5 subfolders)
   │   ├── [feature-2]/   (5 subfolders)
   │   └── [feature-n]/   (5 subfolders)
   ├── dev/           (7 subfolders)
   ├── team/          (3 subfolders)
   ├── feedback/      (6 subfolders)
   ├── roadmap/       (1 subfolder)
   └── changelog/     (1 subfolder)

   Feature folders created:
   - src/bulk-cancellation/
   - src/patient-portal/
   - src/waitlist/

   Created files:
   - README.md
   - CONTRIBUTING.md
   - docs/guides/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

   Next steps:
   1. Update README.md with project description
   2. Run research-synthesis skill to capture initial research
   3. Run user-persona skill to define target users
   4. Run scope-definition skill to define first feature scope
   ```

## Folder Reference

| Root Folder | Purpose | Subfolders |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| `docs/` | Discovery & exploration | research, personas, journeys, IA, briefs, competitive-analysis, requirements, guides, reusable, migration, style, archive |
| `design/` | Design artifacts | ui/ (style-guide, icons, illustrations, components, design-system), ux/ (wireframes, patterns, flows), prototypes, a11y, animations |
| `src/` | Application source code | **Shared:** components, shared, pages, services, hooks, utils, assets, styles, lib |
| `src/[feature]/` | Feature-specific code | components, hooks, utils, services, types |
| `dev/` | Development tools | tests, config, scripts, types, mocks, deploy, logs |
| `team/` | Team collaboration | docs, meetings, decisions |
| `feedback/` | Feedback & analytics | user-testing, analytics, issues, surveys, session-recordings, bug-reports |
| `roadmap/` | Product planning | milestones |
| `changelog/` | Version history | releases |

## Feature Folder Structure

Each feature folder in `src/[feature-name]/` contains:

```
src/[feature-name]/
├── components/    # Feature-specific React components
├── hooks/         # Feature-specific custom hooks
├── utils/         # Feature-specific utility functions
├── services/      # Feature-specific API services
└── types/         # Feature-specific TypeScript types
```

**When to use feature folders vs shared folders:**

| Use Feature Folder (`src/[feature]/`) | Use Shared Folder (`src/components/`, etc.) |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Component only used by this feature | Component used by 2+ features |
| Hook specific to feature logic | Generic hook (useAuth, useDebounce) |
| API service for feature endpoints | Shared API client, base services |
| Types only for this feature | Shared types across features |

**Adding features later:**
```bash
# Add a new feature folder anytime
mkdir -p src/[new-feature]/{components,hooks,utils,services,types}
```

## Validation Checklist

Before completing initialization:

- [ ] Project name is valid kebab-case
- [ ] All 8 root folders created
- [ ] All subfolders created
- [ ] Feature folders created (if specified in step 3)
- [ ] Each feature folder has 5 subfolders (components, hooks, utils, services, types)
- [ ] .gitkeep files added to empty directories
- [ ] README.md created with project name
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md created
- [ ] PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md copied to docs/guides/

## Error Handling

**Invalid project name:**
- Reject names with spaces, uppercase, or special characters
- Suggest correction: "my app" → "my-app"

**Permission denied:**
- Notify user of permission issue
- Suggest running with appropriate permissions or choosing different location

**Directory already exists with content:**
- Warn user
- Offer to merge (add missing folders only)
- Never overwrite existing files

**Disk space issue:**
- Check available space before creating
- Warn if space is low

## Constraints

- Project names must be kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens only)
- Never overwrite existing files
- Always create .gitkeep in empty folders
- Follow folder structure exactly as defined in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are always created at root

## Tips

1. **Start small** - You don't need to use all folders immediately. The structure grows with your project.

2. **Feature folders** - For large features, create dedicated folders in `src/[feature-name]/`

3. **Archive old work** - Move outdated docs to `docs/archive/` rather than deleting

4. **Keep guides updated** - `docs/guides/` should contain living documentation

5. **Use the decision tree** - When unsure where to put something, refer to PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md's decision tree
