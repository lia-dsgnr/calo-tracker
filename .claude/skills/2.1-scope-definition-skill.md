description: Define clear product scope for features or projects. Use when starting new initiatives, clarifying requirements, or aligning stakeholders on what will (and won't) be built.

# Scope Definition

## Dependencies

Recommended (not required) inputs:
- User research or synthesis → improves Target Users accuracy
- JTBD statements → improves Goal and Success Criteria alignment
- Stakeholder requirements → improves Constraints section

Can run without dependencies if goal is clearly stated.

## When to Use

- "Define the scope for this feature"
- "What should we build for [goal]?"
- "Scope this project"
- "Write a PRD for [feature]"
- "What's in and out of scope?"
- Starting any new feature or project initiative

## Process

1. **Clarify the goal** - If not clearly stated, ask:
   - "What problem are we solving?"
   - "What user outcome do we want?"
   - "What does success look like?"

2. **Identify target users** - Define who benefits:
   - Primary user (design for first)
   - Secondary users (important but not primary)
   - Include role, context, and why they need this

3. **Define features included** - Break into:
   - **Core (MVP):** Must-have for launch
   - **Enhanced (if time permits):** Nice-to-have
   - Each feature should be specific and actionable

4. **Explicitly state out of scope** - Prevent scope creep:
   - List excluded items with rationale
   - "Not now" is different from "never" — clarify timing
   - Reference future phases if applicable

5. **Set success criteria** - Measurable outcomes:
   - Quantitative metrics with targets
   - How and when each will be measured
   - Tie to business or user outcomes, not outputs

6. **Document risks & constraints**
   - **Risks:** What could go wrong + likelihood + impact + mitigation
   - **Constraints:** Technical, legal, resource, timeline limitations

7. **Capture dependencies and open questions**
   - What must exist before this can ship?
   - What decisions are still pending?

8. **Add diagram link** - Ask user for Creately diagram URL:
   - "Do you have a Creately diagram for this scope? If so, please share the link."
   - If user doesn't have one yet: "You can create one at creately.com and share the link later."
   - To get the link: Share → Enable "Anyone with link can view" → Copy link

9. **Format output** - Use template below

10. **Save** - `artifacts/scope-[feature]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Output Template

```markdown
# Product Scope: [Feature Name]

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing scope:

- [ ] Goal is outcome-focused, not solution-focused
- [ ] Target users are specific (not "all users")
- [ ] Each feature is actionable (dev could estimate it)
- [ ] Out of scope items have rationale
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable with specific targets
- [ ] Risks have mitigations, not just identification
- [ ] Constraints are real limitations, not preferences
- [ ] No feature appears in both "included" and "out of scope"
- [ ] Dependencies are systems/teams, not features
- [ ] Open questions are actually unresolved (not rhetorical)

## Anti-Patterns

### Goal

❌ **Solution-focused goal**
```markdown
## Goal
Build a bulk cancellation modal with checkboxes and filters.
```
Why this fails: Describes solution, not problem or outcome.

✅ **Outcome-focused goal**
```markdown
## Goal
Enable clinic staff to cancel multiple appointments at once when a doctor
becomes unavailable, reducing manual effort from ~30 minutes to under 2 minutes.
```

---

### Target Users

❌ **Vague users**
```markdown
| **Primary:** | Users | People who use the app |
```

✅ **Specific users with context**
```markdown
| **Primary: Receptionist** | Front desk staff | Needs to act quickly when
notified of doctor absence, often during peak hours |
```

---

### Features Included

❌ **Vague feature**
```markdown
1. **Better cancellation experience**
```

✅ **Specific, actionable feature**
```markdown
1. **Filter appointments by criteria**
   - By doctor
   - By date/date range
   - By time range (e.g., morning only)
```

---

### Out of Scope

❌ **No rationale**
```markdown
| Auto-rescheduling | Out of scope |
```

✅ **Clear rationale with timing**
```markdown
| Auto-rescheduling to another doctor | Requires availability matching,
patient consent — Phase 2 |
```

---

### Success Criteria

❌ **Unmeasurable criteria**
```markdown
| User satisfaction | Users should be happy | Ask them |
```

✅ **Specific, measurable criteria**
```markdown
| Staff satisfaction | NPS > 40 from front desk staff | Post-launch survey at day 30 |
```

---

### Risks

❌ **Risk without mitigation**
```markdown
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| Data loss | High | High | TBD |
```

✅ **Risk with actionable mitigation**
```markdown
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| Accidental mass cancellation | Medium | High | Confirmation step with
patient count, undo window (5 min) |
```

---

### Scope Creep Patterns

❌ **"And also..." additions**
```markdown
## Features Included
1. Bulk cancel appointments
2. And also auto-reschedule them
3. And also notify the waitlist
4. And also integrate with Google Calendar
```

✅ **Focused MVP with explicit deferrals**
```markdown
## Features Included
1. Bulk cancel appointments

## Out of Scope
| Auto-rescheduling | Phase 2 — requires availability matching |
| Waitlist notification | Separate feature initiative |
| Calendar sync | Phase 2 — integration complexity |
```

## Error Handling

**Goal is unclear or missing:**
- Ask: "What problem are we solving? What does success look like?"
- Do not proceed without clear outcome statement
- Suggest outcome-focused phrasing if user provides solution-focused goal

**No user research available:**
- Proceed with stated assumptions
- Flag in Open Questions: "Target user assumptions need validation"
- Recommend user research before development begins

**Stakeholder disagreement on scope:**
- Document competing perspectives in Open Questions
- Recommend alignment meeting before finalizing
- Do not resolve disagreements by including everything

**Too many features for MVP:**
- Ask: "If you could only ship ONE thing, what would it be?"
- Recommend splitting into phases
- Apply MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)

**Success criteria are outputs, not outcomes:**
- Outputs: "Ship feature by Q2" / "Build 5 screens"
- Outcomes: "Reduce task time by 50%" / "Increase adoption to 80%"
- Guide user toward outcome-focused metrics

**Everything marked "must have":**
- Challenge: "If all are must-have, which would you cut if timeline was halved?"
- Force prioritization by introducing constraint
- Recommend MAX 3-5 core features for MVP

## Constraints

- Goal must be outcome-focused, not solution-focused
- Target users must be specific roles, not "users" or "everyone"
- Features must be specific enough to estimate (not "make it better")
- Success criteria must include measurable target (not just metric name)
- Out of scope must include rationale (not just list of exclusions)
- Risks must include mitigation (identification alone is insufficient)
- Scope document is living — version and date all updates

## Tips for Effective Scoping

1. **Start with the problem, not the solution** — If someone says "build X," ask "what problem does X solve?"

2. **Be specific about users** — "Small business owners who process 50+ expenses/month" beats "SMB users"

3. **Out of scope is protective** — Explicitly listing exclusions prevents scope creep and misaligned expectations

4. **Success criteria drive decisions** — If you can't measure it, you can't know if you succeeded

5. **Constraints are gifts** — They force focus and prevent over-engineering

6. **Open questions are honest** — Acknowledging unknowns builds trust and flags risks early

7. **Review with stakeholders** — Scope is a contract; all parties should agree before work begins
