# User Persona

## Dependencies

Requires research input. Run `research-synthesis` skill first if raw research hasn't been synthesized.

## When to Use
- "Create user personas from this research"
- "Who are our target users?"
- "Define the personas for this product"
- "What user types should we design for?"

## Process

1. **Require research input** - Do not invent personas. Must have:
   - Synthesized interviews (preferred) → `docs/`
   - User surveys or feedback
   - Behavioral/analytics data
   - Customer segments data

2. **If research files not found** (check `docs/` first):
   - Ask user: "Where are your research files located?"
   - Accept file uploads directly in chat
   - Accept pasted research content inline
   - Supported formats: `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`

3. **Identify user segments** - Look for:
   - Distinct behavior patterns
   - Different goals and motivations
   - Varying skill levels or contexts
   - Demographic or role differences that affect product use

4. **Extract persona attributes** for each segment:
   - **Demographics:** Role, experience level, context
   - **Goals:** What they're trying to achieve
   - **Pain points:** Frustrations and obstacles
   - **Behaviors:** How they currently work/act
   - **Motivations:** Why they do what they do
   - **Accessibility needs:** Any impairments or assistive technology use
   - **Quote:** Representative verbatim from research

5. **Write persona narrative** - Create a realistic character:
   - Give a name and photo description (not real person)
   - Write a brief bio in third person
   - Include day-in-the-life context
   - Keep grounded in research data

6. **Prioritize personas:**
   - **Primary:** Main target user, design for first
   - **Secondary:** Important but not primary focus
   - **Accessibility:** Users with impairments (visual, motor, cognitive, auditory)
   - **Negative:** Who we are NOT designing for

7. **Format output** - Use template: `.claude/templates/user-persona.md`

8. **Save** - Create separate file for each persona:
   - Follow naming conventions: `docs/guides/naming-conventions.md`
   - Pattern: `PERS[YYMMDD]-[priority]-[persona-slug].md`
   - Priority prefix:
     - `a` = Primary persona
     - `b` = Secondary persona
     - `c` = Tertiary persona
     - `n` = Negative persona (who we're NOT designing for)
   - Examples:
     - `PERS251209-a-smb-owner.md` (primary)
     - `PERS251209-b-freelance-designer.md` (secondary)
     - `PERS251209-c-enterprise-admin.md` (tertiary)
     - `PERS251209-n-power-user.md` (negative)
   - Save to `artifacts/`

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing personas:
- [ ] Every attribute has research evidence cited
- [ ] Goals and pain points are specific, not generic
- [ ] Behaviors based on observation, not assumption
- [ ] Quote is verbatim from research (not invented)
- [ ] Personas are distinct (no overlap in core needs)
- [ ] 2-4 personas maximum (avoid persona bloat)
- [ ] Primary persona clearly identified
- [ ] Accessibility persona included if research shows users with impairments
- [ ] Negative persona defined if relevant

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Generic demographics**
```markdown
**Name:** Marketing Mary
**Age:** 35
**Role:** Marketing Manager
**Goals:** Wants to do her job better
```
Why this fails: Could describe anyone. No research-backed specificity.

✅ **Research-backed specificity**
```markdown
**Name:** Maria Chen
**Role:** Marketing Manager at B2B SaaS (50-200 employees)
**Context:** Manages 3-person team, reports to CMO, measured on MQLs
**Goals:** "I need to prove ROI to justify my budget" - 7 of 10 interviews
```

❌ **Invented behaviors**
```markdown
**Behaviors:** Probably checks email first thing in the morning
```

✅ **Observed behaviors**
```markdown
**Behaviors:** Starts day in Slack, checks dashboards before standup (observed in 5 of 8 contextual inquiries)
```

❌ **Made-up quotes**
```markdown
**Quote:** "I just want things to work!"
```

✅ **Verbatim research quote**
```markdown
**Quote:** "I spend 2 hours every Monday just copying data between systems" - P4, interview-03.md
```

❌ **Too many personas**
Creating 8+ personas that dilute focus and create confusion about who to design for.

✅ **Focused persona set**
2-3 distinct personas with clear primary/secondary designation.

❌ **Aspirational persona**
Describing the ideal user you wish you had instead of actual users from research.

✅ **Evidence-based persona**
Reflecting real user patterns, even if uncomfortable or unexpected.

❌ **Overlapping personas**
Two personas with essentially the same goals and pain points but different names.

✅ **Distinct personas**
Each persona has meaningfully different goals, contexts, or behaviors that affect product decisions.

❌ **Ignoring accessibility**
```markdown
**Accessibility:** N/A - our users don't have disabilities
```
Why this fails: ~15-20% of population has some form of impairment. Excludes real users.

✅ **Inclusive accessibility consideration**
```markdown
**Accessibility:** Uses screen reader (JAWS) due to low vision. Relies on keyboard navigation. Needs high contrast mode. - P8, interview-05.md
```
Or if no specific research: "No accessibility-specific research conducted yet - recommend inclusive testing."

## Error Handling

**No research input available:**
- Stop: "Personas require research foundation. Cannot proceed."
- Guide user: "Run research-synthesis skill first, or provide research files"
- Do not invent personas from assumptions

**Empty or corrupted file:**
- Notify user: "File X appears empty or unreadable"
- Request alternative format or re-upload
- Do not proceed without valid research

**Research lacks user detail:**
- If research only contains feature requests: "This data lacks user context. Need behavioral data."
- Ask: "Can you provide user interviews or contextual inquiry data?"
- Recommend deeper discovery research

**Cannot distinguish user segments:**
- Flag to user: "Research shows homogeneous user base - may only need 1-2 personas"
- Don't force-create distinct personas where none exist
- Consider: Is one persona with variants sufficient?

**Too many potential personas (5+):**
- Prioritize by frequency and business impact
- Ask user: "Focus on top 2-3, or document all with priority ranking?"
- Recommend consolidating similar segments

**Cannot create output directory:**
- Ask user: "Where should I save this persona document?"
- Offer to output inline in chat
- Provide copy-paste ready markdown

**Unsupported file format:**
- List supported: `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`
- Ask user to convert or paste content directly

## Constraints
- Every persona attribute must cite research evidence
- Limit to 2-4 personas (1 primary, 1-2 secondary, optional negative)
- Do not invent user characteristics without evidence
- Do not create "ideal user" personas - reflect actual research
- Quotes must be verbatim from research sources
