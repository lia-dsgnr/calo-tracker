# Feature List

## Dependencies

Requires scope document as input. Run `scope-definition` skill first if scope hasn't been defined.

## When to Use

- "Create a feature list from this scope"
- "What features do we need to build?"
- "Break down the scope into features"
- "Define the feature set for this project"
- "List all features for [product/feature]"

## Process

1. **Require scope input** - Do not invent features. Must have:
   - Scope document (preferred) → `docs/[product]-scope-*.md`
   - Product requirements document
   - User stories or epics

2. **If scope not found** (check `docs/` first):
   - Ask user: "Where is your scope document located?"
   - Accept file uploads directly in chat
   - Accept pasted scope content inline

3. **Extract features from scope** - For each item in "Features Included":
   - Break into discrete, implementable features
   - Identify sub-features if complex
   - Map to user types from scope

4. **Assign feature attributes:**
   - **ID:** Sequential identifier (F-001, F-002...)
   - **Feature Name:** Short, descriptive name (2-5 words)
   - **Description:** What it does + key capabilities (1-2 sentences)
   - **User Type:** Who uses it (from Target Users in scope)
   - **Priority:** P0 (MVP) / P1 (Enhanced) / P2 (Future)
   - **Dependencies:** Other features or systems required
   - **Status:** Not Started / In Progress / Done

5. **Map dependencies:**
   - Identify which features depend on others
   - Note external system dependencies
   - Flag blocking dependencies

6. **Include future features** - From "Out of Scope":
   - Document as P2 with rationale
   - Helps prevent scope creep ("it's planned for later")

7. **Format output** - Use template below

8. **Save** - `artifacts/feature-list-[context]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Output Template

```markdown
---
type: feature-list
product: [Product name]
scope_ref: [Path to scope document]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
version: 1

# Feature List: [Product/Feature Name]

## Overview

**Goal:** [From scope document]
**Target Users:** [Primary, Secondary users]

---

## P0 - Core (MVP)

| ID | Feature | Description | User Type | Dependencies | Status |
|----|---------|-------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| F-001 | [Name] | [Description] | [User] | [Deps] | Not Started |
| F-002 | [Name] | [Description] | [User] | [Deps] | Not Started |

---

## P1 - Enhanced

| ID | Feature | Description | User Type | Dependencies | Status |
|----|---------|-------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| F-00X | [Name] | [Description] | [User] | [Deps] | Not Started |

---

## P2 - Future (Out of Scope)

| ID | Feature | Rationale | Target Phase |
|----|---------|-----------|--------------|
| F-00X | [Name] | [Why deferred] | Phase 2 |

---

## Dependency Map

```
F-001 (Filter)
└── F-002 (Bulk selection) ← requires filter results
    └── F-003 (Bulk action) ← requires selection
        └── F-004 (Notification) ← triggered by action
```

---

## External Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Owner | Status |
|------------|------|-------|--------|
| [System/API] | [Required/Optional] | [Team] | [Available/Pending] |
```

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing feature list:

- [ ] Every feature traces back to scope document
- [ ] Feature names are specific (not "improve X" or "better Y")
- [ ] Descriptions explain what, not how (implementation-agnostic)
- [ ] Each feature has clear user type assigned
- [ ] Priority reflects scope's MVP vs Enhanced distinction
- [ ] Dependencies are features or systems, not tasks
- [ ] No duplicate features (consolidate if overlapping)
- [ ] P2 features include rationale for deferral
- [ ] Dependency map shows blocking relationships
- [ ] Status is realistic (most should be "Not Started")

## Anti-Patterns

### Feature Name

❌ **Vague name**
```markdown
| F-001 | Better UX | Improve the experience | All users |
```
Why this fails: Not actionable. What specifically is being built?

✅ **Specific name**
```markdown
| F-001 | Filter appointments | Filter by doctor, date range, time slot | Receptionist |
```

---

### Description

❌ **Implementation-focused**
```markdown
| F-002 | Checkbox list | Add checkboxes with React state management | Developer |
```

✅ **Outcome-focused**
```markdown
| F-002 | Bulk selection | Select/deselect multiple appointments, show count | Receptionist |
```

---

### Priority

❌ **Everything is P0**
```markdown
| F-001 | Core feature | ... | P0 |
| F-002 | Nice-to-have | ... | P0 |
| F-003 | Future idea | ... | P0 |
```

✅ **Honest prioritization**
```markdown
| F-001 | Core feature | ... | P0 |
| F-002 | Nice-to-have | ... | P1 |
| F-003 | Future idea | ... | P2 |
```

---

### Dependencies

❌ **Tasks as dependencies**
```markdown
| Dependencies |
| Write tests, review PR, deploy |
```

✅ **Features/systems as dependencies**
```markdown
| Dependencies |
| F-001 (Filter), Notification API |
```

---

### User Type

❌ **Generic user**
```markdown
| User Type |
| User |
| Everyone |
| All |
```

✅ **Specific role**
```markdown
| User Type |
| Receptionist |
| Office Manager |
| Doctor (self-service) |
```

---

### Scope Creep in Feature List

❌ **Adding features not in scope**
```markdown
## P0 - Core (MVP)
| F-006 | Calendar sync | Sync with Google Calendar | Admin |
```
(When Calendar sync was explicitly Out of Scope)

✅ **Respecting scope boundaries**
```markdown
## P2 - Future (Out of Scope)
| F-006 | Calendar sync | Integration complexity — Phase 2 | Phase 2 |
```

## Error Handling

**No scope document available:**
- Stop: "Feature list requires scope document. Cannot proceed."
- Guide user: "Run scope-definition skill first, or provide scope document"
- Do not invent features from assumptions

**Scope is too vague:**
- If scope says "improve performance" without specifics: "Scope lacks feature detail. Need specific capabilities."
- Ask: "Can you break down what 'improve performance' means?"
- Request scope refinement before proceeding

**Too many features identified (15+):**
- Challenge: "15+ features may indicate scope creep. Should we split into releases?"
- Recommend grouping into epics
- Ask user to confirm priorities

**Features overlap:**
- Identify overlap: "F-003 and F-007 both handle notifications. Consolidate?"
- Recommend single feature with sub-capabilities
- Don't create duplicate features

**Dependencies create circular reference:**
- Flag: "F-001 depends on F-003, which depends on F-001 — circular dependency"
- Recommend breaking cycle by identifying core capability
- May indicate need to refactor feature breakdown

**Cannot determine priority:**
- Default to P1 if truly ambiguous
- Ask user: "Is [feature] required for launch or nice-to-have?"
- Never default everything to P0

## Constraints

- Every feature must trace to scope document
- Feature names must be specific and actionable (2-5 words)
- Descriptions explain what (outcome), not how (implementation)
- Maximum 10-12 P0 features (if more, split into releases)
- Dependencies are features or systems, never tasks
- P2 features always include rationale for deferral
- Status reflects reality (don't mark In Progress if not started)
