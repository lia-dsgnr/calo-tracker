# Task List

## Dependencies

Requires clear user goal or feature description as input. Works best with scope or feature list document.

## When to Use

- "Create a task list for [feature/goal]"
- "Break down the UX for [user action]"
- "What tasks are needed for [feature]?"
- "Document the flow for [user goal]"
- "Plan the steps for [feature implementation]"

## Process

1. **Clarify the goal** - Must understand:
   - What is the user trying to accomplish?
   - Who are the actors involved?
   - What triggers this flow?
   - What is the end state?

2. **If goal is unclear:**
   - Ask: "What is the specific user goal?"
   - Request context: scope document, feature list, or user story
   - Do not invent requirements from assumptions

3. **Identify all actors:**
   - Primary user (who initiates)
   - Secondary users (who else is involved)
   - Affected parties (who is impacted)
   - System (what automation handles)

4. **Map the user flow:**
   - Start state → End state
   - Happy path first
   - Key decision points
   - Keep to 5-8 major steps

5. **Break each step into tasks:**
   - **Task ID:** Sequential (1.1, 1.2, 2.1...)
   - **Task:** Specific action (verb + noun)
   - **Description:** What happens
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** How to verify done

6. **Define success criteria:**
   - Functional (does it work?)
   - Performance (is it fast enough?)
   - Usability (can users complete it?)
   - Measurable targets for each

7. **Document edge cases:**
   - Empty states (no data)
   - Invalid input
   - System failures
   - Concurrent users
   - Undo/recovery
   - Assign priority: High/Medium/Low

8. **Format output** - Use template below

9. **Save** - `artifacts/TASK[YYMMDD]-[feature-slug].md`
   - Example: `TASK251211-bulk-cancel-appointments.md`

## Output Template

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing task list:

- [ ] Goal is clearly stated and specific
- [ ] All actors identified with clear roles
- [ ] User flow covers happy path completely
- [ ] Each step has actionable tasks
- [ ] Every task has acceptance criteria
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Edge cases cover failure scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases have defined expected behavior
- [ ] Open questions documented (not assumed)

## Anti-Patterns

### Goal Statement

❌ **Vague goal**
```markdown
**Goal:** Improve appointment management
```
Why this fails: Not specific. What action? What outcome?

✅ **Specific goal**
```markdown
**Goal:** Enable staff to cancel all appointments for a doctor on a specific day due to illness
```

---

### Actor Definition

❌ **Generic actors**
```markdown
| Actor | Role |
| User | Uses the system |
| Admin | Manages things |
```

✅ **Specific actors**
```markdown
| Actor | Role |
| Receptionist | Initiates cancellation, selects doctor and date |
| Patient | Receives notification, may reschedule |
```

---

### Task Description

❌ **Implementation-focused**
```markdown
| 2.1 | onClick handler fires API call | Code executes |
```

✅ **User-focused**
```markdown
| 2.1 | User selects doctor from list | Selection confirmed visually |
```

---

### Acceptance Criteria

❌ **Vague criteria**
```markdown
| Acceptance Criteria |
| Works correctly |
| User is happy |
```

✅ **Testable criteria**
```markdown
| Acceptance Criteria |
| List loads within 2 seconds |
| Selection is highlighted and name displayed |
```

---

### Edge Cases

❌ **Missing expected behavior**
```markdown
| E1 | No appointments | - | High |
```

✅ **Complete edge case**
```markdown
| E1 | No appointments exist | Show message "No appointments to cancel", disable proceed button | High |
```

---

### Success Criteria

❌ **Not measurable**
```markdown
| Criteria | Target |
| Fast | Quick |
| Reliable | Works |
```

✅ **Measurable**
```markdown
| Criteria | Target | How to Measure |
| Response time | < 2 seconds | Performance testing |
| Notification delivery | 100% within 5 min | Delivery logs |
```

## Edge Case Categories

When documenting edge cases, consider these categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Empty states** | No data, no results, no selection |
| **Boundary conditions** | Min/max values, character limits |
| **Invalid input** | Wrong format, missing required fields |
| **Timing issues** | Concurrent users, timeouts, slow network |
| **Permission issues** | Unauthorized access, expired session |
| **State conflicts** | Already processed, duplicate action |
| **External failures** | API down, service unavailable |
| **Undo/recovery** | Reverse action, restore state |
| **Partial completion** | Some items succeed, others fail |

## Error Handling

**Goal is too vague:**
- Stop: "Need specific user goal. What action and outcome?"
- Do not proceed with assumptions
- Request clarification before creating task list

**Too many steps identified (10+):**
- Challenge: "10+ steps may indicate multiple features. Should we split?"
- Recommend breaking into sub-flows
- Ask user to confirm scope

**Cannot identify actors:**
- Ask: "Who initiates this action? Who is affected?"
- Do not default to generic "User"
- Every flow has at least one specific actor

**Edge cases overlap:**
- Consolidate similar scenarios
- Group by category
- Don't create duplicate entries

**Success criteria unmeasurable:**
- Ask: "How will we know [criterion] is met?"
- Suggest specific metrics
- Remove criteria that cannot be verified

## Constraints

- Goal must be specific and actionable
- Actors must be specific roles, never generic "User"
- Tasks describe what (user action), not how (implementation)
- Acceptance criteria must be testable/verifiable
- Success criteria must be measurable with specific targets
- Edge cases must include expected behavior
- Maximum 8 major steps (if more, split into sub-flows)
- Every edge case has a priority assigned
- Open questions documented, not assumed
