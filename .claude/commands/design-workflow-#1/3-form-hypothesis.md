**Optional:** Validated assumptions, Research insights

## Command

Based on the validated assumptions, form a testable hypothesis using this structure:

**If** [we implement this specific solution/change]
**then** [this measurable outcome will occur]
**for** [this specific user segment]
**because** [this is the underlying mechanism/insight]

Requirements:
- The outcome must be measurable (include target metric and threshold)
- The user segment must be specific (reference persona if available)
- The "because" must connect assumptions to the expected outcome
- State what success looks like numerically (e.g., "20%+ increase")

Also provide:
- **Supporting assumptions:** Which 2-3 key assumptions does this depend on?
- **Research insight:** What evidence supports the "because"?
- **Falsification criteria:** What result would prove this wrong?

If multiple strong hypotheses emerge, rank them by:
1. **Assumptions solved:** How many high-risk assumptions does this validate?
2. **Impact potential:** What's the upside if true?
3. **Confidence level:** How strong is the supporting evidence?
4. **Speed to validate:** How quickly can we test and learn?
